Assignment 2: Static webhosting for visualizations through github

# **Personal Website for Assignment 2**

## **Project Overview**
For Assignment 2 in IAT 355, I created a personal website designed to function as a professional online portfolio. The site highlights my skills, educational background, and some visualizations achieved through D3.js library, in a clear and organized way. It consists of several pages, including a homepage and a dedicated visualizations page, all built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## **Purpose**
The website is designed as an online portfolio that presents my experience, technical abilities, and visualization work. It offers a structured and professional platform to highlight my capabilities while illustrating my knowledge of front-end web development tools and design practices.


## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
- **CSS3:** For styling the website and ensuring it works seamlessly on all devices with different display sceens.
- **JavaScript :** For adding interactivity to the website and handling active nav bar display and SVG visualizations.
- **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):** Used to create a custom visual artwork and a recreated version of a visualization covered in class.

## **Project Structure**
The website consists of the following key files:

- **`index.html`:** This is the homepage of the website. It includes:
  - A personal introduction, where I highlight my education, skills, and experience.
  - Nav bar Links to contact information and my GitHub profile.
  
- **`visualizations.html`:** A dedicated page to showcase visualizations. It contains:
  - An SVG version of a visualization showcasing total number of billionaires by per country through 2004-2007..
  - A creative custom SVG drawing I designed using code.
  
- **`style.css`:** This file handles the layout and visual design of the website. It ensures that the content is presented in a clean and user-friendly way, and works on different display sizes.

- **`main.js`:** This JavaScript file includes interactivity features like showing active nav bar link and dynamic elements for the homepage.

- **`vis.js`:** Contains JavaScript code for rendering and interacting with SVG graphics on the visualizations page.

- **`README.md`:** This file (you're reading it!) explains the purpose of the website, the technologies used, and how to navigate the project.

## **How to Navigate the Website**
1. **Homepage (`index.html`):**
   - Navigate to the homepage to learn more about me. The homepage includes information about my educational background, professional experience, and contact details.
   - There are links to resources like my GitHub page and linked in page in the footer.

2. **Visualizations Page (`visualizations.html`):**
   - This page features two main visualizations:
     1. An SVG version of the visualization created to showcase the total number of billionaires from 2004-2007, data set exported from Gapminder.
     2. A custom SVG artwork created for this assignment.
   - JavaScript-driven interactivity is embedded in the page to allow you to explore these visualizations according to years.
